This is basic snake game created through HTML, CSS, and Javascript

In this game I demonstrate my use of Javascript along with HTML to recreate the classic game of Snake.
I comment the Javascript very well and make it readable for all of those that would like to take a 
closer look at it. Very simple design and program but I hope you enjoy!
